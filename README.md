### JavaScript Algorithm Practice w/ TDD

- I'm trying to re-frame the way I think about and tackle code, in an attempt to get back to basics. Frameworks and libs are cool, but I'd rather have the vanilla JS knowledge that will carry me through the ebbs and flows of this wild ecosystem. In the spirit of that idea, this is a place for me to practice JS algorithms and use [TDD](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) while I'm at it.

### Goals

- Complete 5 algorithms per week from Nov 13, 2017 to Jan 31, 2018. (Update 4/9/19: I failed!)
- Use TDD.
- Start with the five basic problem-solving steps found [here](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/stuck-on-a-coding-problem-here-are-5-steps-to-solve-it-8be04c4b4f19).

### Resources

- I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com) JS algorithms.
- [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
