### JavaScript Algorithm Practice w/ TDD

- I'm trying to re-frame the way I think about and tackle code, in an attempt to get [back to basics](http://ashlylamarr.me/getting-back-to-basics/). In the spirit of that idea, this is a place for me to practice JS algorithms, learn [TDD](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html), and keep git fresh in my mind since we use an in-house VCS at work.

### Goals

- Complete 5 algorithms per week from Nov 13, 2017 to Jan 31, 2018.
- Use TDD.
- Start with the five basic problem-solving steps found [here](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/stuck-on-a-coding-problem-here-are-5-steps-to-solve-it-8be04c4b4f19).

### Resources

- I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com) JS algorithms. This serves a two-fold purpose as I'm currently helping newer devs learn these concepts through [weekly FCC classes](https://twitter.com/FreeCodeCampSLC) here in Salt Lake City.
